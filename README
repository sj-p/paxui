Q: What is Paxui?
A: Paxui is a program for visualisation & manipulation of audio streams within a pulseaudio server on a GNU/Linux desktop. It facillitates moving streams to a different source or sink, adding/removing loopback modules or null-sinks, adjusting the level of a stream or muting it.

Q: What ISN'T Paxui?
A: Paxui is not a full-featured pulseaudio configuration tool. You'll still need pavucontrol, pacmd, pactl and the like for some things, but hopefully Paxui will make performing some tasks a little easier.

Q: How do I build Paxui?
A: Paxui is written in C, so you'll need a working C compiler. You'll need to have glib-2.0, gtk+-3, libpulse & libpulse-mainloop-glib installed, including development packages if your distro separates them. There's no configure script, just a simple Makefile that ought to work for most standard installs: run command 'make' then you can use 'paxui' from the build directory. If you use a non-standard setup, you'll have to adjust the Makefile accordingly.

Q: How do I use Paxui?
A: To move the input of a module or client to a different source, drag'n'drop its source-output onto the new source. To move the output of a module or client to a different sink, drag'n'drop its sink-input onto the new sink.
You can move items within columns 'Sources', 'Modules & Clients' and 'Sinks' by dragging the item to an empty row.
Right-clicking on things will show options regarding adding/removing loopbacks & null-sinks.

Q: Can I set volume levels in Paxui ?
A: Click the gear icon on an item to reveal volume sliders & mute button. A lock button is also provided so you can lock all channels in the stream to the same level (default: unlocked). You can disable these controls by using the boolean config option VolumeControlsDisabled.

Q: What configuration options does Paxui have?
A: On starting, Paxui tries to read a configuration file at $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/paxui/paxui.conf and expects lines in the form Key=Value (no spaces around =). Blank lines & lines beginning # are ignored. Boolean values are a single character: True is one of "1YyTt", False is one of "0NnFf". Keys currently recognised are VolumeControlsDisabled, DarkTheme, LineColour and Image* - see later questions on themes and customising.
Paxui also tries to load user CSS from $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/paxui/paxui.css - again see customising.
(NB: $XDG_CONFIG_HOME defaults to $HOME/.config)

Q: Does Paxui work with dark themes?
A: It should. Hopefully. It looks at the global GTK setting "gtk-application-prefer-dark-theme" and adjusts some of its colours accordingly. You can overrule that setting by adding the boolean option DarkTheme in your config file (True if you ARE using a dark theme, False if you are NOT using a dark theme).

Q: How customisable is Paxui?
A: Quite a bit. As already mentioned, user CSS can be loaded. Class names 'source', 'source-output', 'client', 'module', 'sink-input' and 'sink' are given to elements representing similarly named pulseaudio objects, while 'outer' is given to all of those.
If you wish to change the colours representing active streams, you can do that in paxui.conf with the key LineColour: use it as many times as you want colours. If no valid colours are set, the default set of 8 is used. Colour values can be a C-style number for a 32-bit ARGB value (alpha in the high byte); or you can use HTML-style hex format (either #rrggbb or #rrggbbaa).
If you want to replace the images used in the GUI, use the config keys Image* where * is one of {Source,Sink,Switch,Gear,Muted,Unmuted,Locked,Unlocked}, with the path to your file as the value. The built-in images for {Source,Sink,Switch} are 32x32 pixels, all others 24x24 pixels.

Q: Why 'paxui'?
A: Some may say that 'pa' means 'PulseAudio' & 'ui' means 'User Interface'; others may disagree.
